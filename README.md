##Purpose
Thinkful has an open source team made up of students and mentors working along side eachother to enhance and suppliment the learning curriculum with experience working on real projects together with developers and developers in-training with skill sets ranging across a wide variety of curriculum focuses. The bottom line, we have a group, and we need projects. This application is being created to accept project recommendations and allow the community to vote, comment, and discuss project ideas anonymously. Projects with high community support will be added to the project list, repositories created, and contributions opened.
